# Spring Boot (Maven) and React.js REST backend
A simple Spring Boot + React REST manipulation of an employee list.
<br>The UI is plaint, because the main point of this little backend program is to understand how Spring and React can work together.
<br>         ---- Nonetheless, UI might be updated later -----
<br>You can GET, POST, DELETE, PUT the employee.
